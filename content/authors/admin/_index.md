#    summary: |
#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

Eurekaimer is a student at the School of Statistics and Data Science at Nankai University. My current interests lie in random analysis and natural language processing. I hope to follow in the footsteps of Kolmogorov, Gauss, Riemann, and others to leave a mark on the universe.
